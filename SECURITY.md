## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report

Email security concerns to: **security@brainsait.com**

Include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Affected versions**
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested mitigation** (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment:** Within 72 hours
- **Progress updates:** Every 7 days
- **Resolution:** Varies by severity (Critical: 7-14 days, High: 30 days, Medium: 60 days)

### Disclosure Policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure**:

1. We will investigate and validate the report
2. We will develop and test a fix
3. We will release the fix and a security advisory
4. We will credit the reporter (unless anonymity is requested)

**Embargo period:** 90 days from initial report (or until patch is released, whichever comes first)

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT tokens** with short expiration (15 minutes)
- **Refresh tokens** stored securely (HTTP-only cookies)
- **Multi-factor authentication** support (TOTP)
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- **Session invalidation** on password change

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at rest:** MongoDB encrypted storage engine
- **Encryption in transit:** TLS 1.3 for all connections
- **Field-level encryption** for PHI (Protected Health Information)
- **Key rotation** every 90 days
- **Data anonymization** for analytics

### HIPAA Compliance

- **Audit logging** of all PHI access
- **Automatic session timeout** (15 minutes inactivity)
- **Data retention policies** enforced
- **Business Associate Agreements** (BAA) with third-party services
- **Regular security risk assessments**

### Infrastructure Security

- **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Cloudflare
- **DDoS protection:** Built-in Cloudflare
- **Rate limiting:** API endpoints (100 req/min per IP)
- **CSP (Content Security Policy):** Strict header enforcement
- **CORS:** Restricted to whitelisted origins

### Code Security

- **Dependency scanning:** Automated with Dependabot
- **Static analysis:** ESLint security plugins
- **Secret scanning:** GitHub secret detection
- **Container scanning:** Docker image vulnerability checks
- **Regular updates:** Weekly dependency reviews

### Monitoring & Incident Response

- **Real-time alerting** for suspicious activity
- **Audit trail** for all user actions
- **Automated backups** every 6 hours
- **Disaster recovery plan** (RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour)
- **Incident response team** on-call 24/7

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review

- All changes require peer review
- Security-focused review for auth/data handling
- Automated security checks in CI/CD

### Testing

- Security-focused unit tests
- Penetration testing quarterly
- Vulnerability scanning monthly

### Deployment

- Secrets managed via environment variables
- No hard-coded credentials
- Immutable infrastructure (containerized deployments)
- Zero-downtime deployments

## Known Security Considerations

### Third-Party Dependencies

We rely on:

- **Next.js** – Regular updates for security patches
- **FastAPI** – Python 3.12+ with security updates
- **MongoDB** – Enterprise-grade security features
- **Cloudflare** – Edge network security

### Data Storage

- **PHI retention:** 7 years (Saudi healthcare regulations)
- **Soft deletes:** Data marked deleted but retained for audit
- **Backup encryption:** AES-256
- **Geographic restrictions:** Data stored in Saudi Arabia (compliance)

### API Security

- **Input validation:** All endpoints use Pydantic/Zod schemas
- **SQL injection:** Not applicable (MongoDB NoSQL)
- **XSS protection:** React auto-escaping + CSP
- **CSRF protection:** SameSite cookies + CSRF tokens

## Compliance Certifications

- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **Saudi NPHIES** (National Platform for Health Information Exchange Services)
- **ISO 27001** (Information Security Management) – In progress
- **SOC 2 Type II** – Planned for 2025

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators

- Enable **multi-factor authentication**
- Use **strong passwords** (16+ characters)
- Regularly **review audit logs**
- **Rotate API keys** every 90 days
- **Limit user permissions** to minimum required

### For Developers

- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- Use **environment variables** for configuration
- Follow **principle of least privilege**
- **Sanitize user inputs** before processing
- **Log security events** (failed logins, privilege escalations)

### For End Users

- **Log out** when finished
- **Report suspicious activity** immediately
- Use **official clients** only (no third-party apps)
- **Verify TLS certificate** when accessing platform
- **Do not share credentials**

## Security Roadmap

### Q1 2025

- Implement **advanced anomaly detection** (ML-based)
- Add **zero-trust network access** (ZTNA)
- Conduct **penetration test** with external firm

### Q2 2025

- Achieve **ISO 27001 certification**
- Add **hardware security module** (HSM) integration
- Launch **bug bounty program**

### Q3 2025
