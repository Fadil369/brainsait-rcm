**Status:** Pushed to origin/main

#### Commit: `8e1feca`
**Message:** "chore: sync local working changes and build artifacts"

**Files Updated (10 files, 800 insertions, 164 deletions):**
- `apps/api-worker/src/routes/auth.ts`

**Note:** All code was manually reviewed and TypeScript compiled successfully before commit.
